# Locating Portuguese Towns

This repo contains my work with researchers at the Duke Digital Art History and Visual Culture Research Lab.

For this project, I worked with a manuscript titled _Memoria para servir de indice dos forales das terras do reino de Portugal e seus dominios_, roughly translated as _An Index of the Charters of the Lands of the Kingdom of Portugal and its Domains_. This manuscript is very old (dated 1825) and its scanned pages are provided in PDF form.

My task was to effectively digitize the list of thousands of towns listed in the PDF and help map them, so the researchers could better understand how Portugal has changed from being under Moorish rule, to being a 
colonial power and finally, to its current state. All my work was done in Python and can be found in the Jupyter notebook in this repo, along with comments explaining the process. I made extensive use of the following libraries in particular for this task - cv2, matplotlib, Tesseract OCR. 

I hope you find the work interesting!
